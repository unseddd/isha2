# iSHA-2: the (in)Secure Hashing Algorithm 2

This is a largely untested, hopefully correct version of the SHA2 family of hashing algorithms defined by [RFC-4634](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4634).

# WARNING: CONTAINS CRYPTOGRAPHIC CODE UNTESTED BY THE CRYPTOGRAPHIC COMMUNITY

Cryptographic libraries should always go through rigorous review and testing by relevant experts before seeing practical use.

This library has received *neither* of those.

I have done my best to implement and test the algorithm to ensure correctness, but this library is purely to learn about how SHA2 actually works.

*Please* do not use this library for anything besides toy/educational purposes.
